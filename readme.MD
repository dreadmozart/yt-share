**I don't really know why google has refused to allow sharing private videos using their API**

I have built this CLI tool that shares your video to emails.
You can extend its functions and improve on it.


* Since only private emails can be shared via email, the script 1st converts to private video.
* Update the run.php file and set the parameters like email, password and share_emails.
* Just two lines are written to console, login state and sharing state.



Enjoy while it lasts.
